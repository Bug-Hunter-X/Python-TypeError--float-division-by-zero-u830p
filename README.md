# Python TypeError: float division by zero

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python related to float division by zero.  The `bug.py` file contains code that raises a `TypeError` under specific conditions.  The solution, provided in `bugSolution.py`, addresses this error.

## Bug Description

The initial code checks if a value x is equal to 0, and if so returns 0. However, it doesn't handle the case where `x` is a floating-point number that is very close to 0 but not exactly 0.  This leads to a `TypeError` when attempting to divide by a floating point zero.
